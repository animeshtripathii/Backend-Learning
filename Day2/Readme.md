On Day 2, I studied libuv. Libuv is a multi-platform support library that focuses on asynchronous I/O. It is a core part of Node.js, enabling non-blocking, event-driven architecture by providing an event loop and abstracting various system operations such as file system access, networking, and concurrency. Understanding libuv is important for backend development because it allows Node.js to handle multiple operations efficiently without blocking the main thread.
