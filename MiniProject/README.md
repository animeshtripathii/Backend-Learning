# Day 7 - Mini Project

## Overview
This is Day 7, and here I will build a small project to master CRUD operations using Express.js. The goal is to create a simple server for an online food delivery app.

## Project Description
In this project, there will be two main roles:

- **Admin**
- **User**

### Admin Features
The admin will be able to:
- List new food items
- Rename food items
- Change the price of food items (update)
- Delete food items

### User Features
The user will be able to:
- View all available food items
- Add food items to their cart
- Remove food items from their cart

## Purpose
This mini project will help me practice and understand CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Express.js by simulating a real-world scenario of an online food delivery application.


## Middleware Usage
I am also using middleware in this project. Middleware functions in Express.js help process requests before they reach the route handlers. For example, I use `express.json()` to parse incoming JSON data, and custom middleware to log requests or check authentication. Middleware makes the code modular, reusable, and easier to manage, especially for tasks like validation, logging, and error handling.

## Frontend Work
For testing and interacting with the backend server, I will use Postman as the frontend tool. Postman allows me to send requests, view responses, and verify all CRUD operations easily during development.

I will implement all the required routes and logic to handle these operations, ensuring both admin and user functionalities are covered in a clear and organized way.
